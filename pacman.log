[2023-02-11T22:59:20+0100] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] In order to start using this driver, there are certain things that have to be configured manually.
[2023-02-11T22:59:20+0100] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] 
[2023-02-11T22:59:20+0100] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] [1m[32mReplug[0m your tablet if it is connected. This will re-trigger the udev rules accordingly.
[2023-02-11T22:59:20+0100] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] 
[2023-02-11T22:59:20+0100] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] The daemon can be started with:

[2023-02-11T22:59:20+0100] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] You can fork it to the background and use output redirection to a log file if desired.
[2023-02-11T22:59:20+0100] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] A systemd user service is also provided and can be used instead:

[2023-02-11T22:59:20+0100] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] You will have to manually disable built-in kernel modules in order for this driver to work properly.
[2023-02-11T22:59:20+0100] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] This can be done by blacklisting the kernel module by creating a file in [32m/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf[0m with a single line:
[2023-02-11T22:59:20+0100] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET]     [32mblacklist <module>[0m
[2023-02-11T22:59:20+0100] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] Where <module> is 'wacom' if you own a wacom tablet, and 'hid_uclogic' otherwise.
[2023-02-11T22:59:20+0100] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] To unload the module immediately, run:
